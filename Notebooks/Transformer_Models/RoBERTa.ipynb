The cable, dated Oct 23 and written by someone within the Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) to an unknown recipient, also says Mugabe spoke to South African President Jacob Zuma about his rivalry with Emmerson Mnangagwa, the vice president whose sacking by Mugabe prompted the army action. The 93-year-old president stepped down on Tuesday, the speaker of parliament said, in the middle of impeachment proceedings from his own ZANU-PF party and after a week of pressure from the military and crowds which thronged the capital at the weekend. Two party officials said Mnangagwa would take his place. The cable, one of a series seen by Reuters this year which give a detailed, insider s view of Zimbabwean politics, described intelligence officials warning Mugabe he would face  fierce resistance from the military  if Mnangagwa was removed. First seen by Reuters before the army intervened, it said the 16-country Southern African Development Community (SADC) led by Zuma was pressuring Mugabe to resign and Zuma had suggested offering him a senior African Union role to ease him out. Zuma s spokesman, Bongani Ngqulunga, dismissed the account as  completely untrue and scandalous .  President Jacob Zuma did not communicate with President Mugabe about former Vice-President Mnangagwa at all about the issues you mention.  Regional support allowed Mugabe to overcome an election setback in 2008 and could have held the key to his future as leader this time round. SADC leaders met on Tuesday to discuss the crisis in Zimbabwe; Zuma and his Angolan counterpart, Joao Lourenco, were set to travel to Harare on Wednesday.  All SADC leaders and African leaders want Mugabe to retire. Mugabe is seen as an embarrassment to the whole African continent,  the document said. A Zambian government source said Zuma, at the SADC meeting in Luanda, floated the idea of an AU position for Mugabe although the consensus was that he was too old. Reuters was not able to verify the assertion of widespread African opposition to Mugabe in the Oct 23 cable, which contrasts with his image as the respected  grand old man  of African politics. Botswana President Ian Khama is the only African leader to have openly called for him to step down. Khama told Reuters on Friday Mugabe should go and allow for  an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity . Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, a longtime strongman leader like Mugabe, condemned the de facto seizure of power by the army, which put troops on the streets of Harare and took over the state broadcaster. Uganda, which is not in the SADC, reiterated its support for Mugabe on Tuesday.  Mugabe is one person who couldn t care what the West thought. He spoke out for Africans  rights, pan Africanism,  said Okello Oryem, Uganda s state minister for foreign affairs. SADC and the African Union (AU) have avoided characterizing last week s intervention by the military as a  coup , a definition that would carry diplomatic consequences. The AU had no immediate comment on the account in the cable. The cable said Zuma told Zimbabwe s longtime leader that Mnangagwa, a former security chief known as  The Crocodile , was a  tricky customer  with  many lives  and that by taking him on Mugabe was  playing with big fire . Mnangagwa is widely expected to take over as president. His whereabouts are unknown after he fled the country citing fears for his safety. His political allies were not immediately available for comment. The same cable said Zimbabwean intelligence officers and SADC leaders told Mugabe the army would not accept Mnangagwa being fired as vice-president to pave the way for Mugabe s 52-year-old wife, Grace, to succeed him.  Mugabe was openly told by senior CIOs that the military is not going to easily accept the appointment of Grace,  it read. The intelligence services of other countries in the region also knew the military might rebel and step in, it continued.  SADC leaders also shared the same sentiments with the CIOs,  the cable said. Reuters reported in September that Mnangagwa was plotting to succeed Mugabe, with army backing, at the helm of a broad coalition. (nL4N1LL3V1) The plot posited an interim unity government with international blessing to allow for Zimbabwe s re-engagement with the world after decades of isolation from global lenders and donors.\",\n          \"The man giving out sign language during Governor Scott s presser has caused a stir on social media.

The government is in the final stage of formalizing the schedule, said the Asahi, citing several sources. In June, Japan s parliament passed a law allowing Emperor Akihito to abdicate and the government needs to hammer out the details including the timing.  Japan s top government spokesman denied the Asahi report.  We are not aware of the report and there is not such fact,  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference.  We will continue to discuss appropriately and will do our best to carry out the emperor s abdication smoothly,  he said. Akihito, 83, who has had heart surgery and treatment for prostate cancer, said in rare public remarks last year he feared age might make it hard for him to continue to fulfill his duties.  He will be succeeded by Naruhito, 57, and a new era will start from April 1, the Asahi reported. The abdication law, which applies only to Akihito and not to future emperors, included a resolution to debate letting female royals stay in the imperial family after marriage but did not touch on the controversial topic of allowing women to inherit. Asahi said the expected 2019 abdication schedule would minimize the impact on people in changing to a new imperial reign from the current Heisei Era, which started in 1989 after the death of Akihito s father Hirohito, according to the Asahi.  The Imperial Household Agency also wanted the transition to take place in spring 2019 as many ritual events are scheduled for the imperial family in autumn and winter, the report said. Akihito, the first Japanese emperor who was never considered divine, has worked for decades at home and abroad to soothe the wounds of World War Two which was fought in his father Hirohito s name.  In a written remarks of her 83rd birthday on Friday, Empress Michiko said that she thought this year her travels with Emperor Ahikito around Japan might be their last and have become deeply emotional.  The Empress also said she felt  an immeasurable sense of peace  that Akihito will be able to rest and spend quiet days after years of pursuing how the Emperor should be.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"subject\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Government News\",\n          \"News\",\n          \"politicsNews\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2376,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"January 24, 2016 \",\n          \"June 21, 2016\",\n          \"Aug 8, 2015\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"title_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 23,\n        \"min\": 8,\n        \"max\": 279,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 204,\n        \"samples\": [\n          56,\n          95\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"text_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1993,\n        \"min\": 45,\n        \"max\": 51793,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6178,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2391,\n          1282\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 27209,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two more women accuse Senate candidate Moore of sexual misconduct Two more women came forward on Wednesday with allegations of sexual misconduct against Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, one accusing him of groping her and the other of forcing a kiss on her when he was 30 and she was about 18. They are the sixth and seventh women to accuse Moore of sexual improprieties since his race for the Alabama Senate seat began. Most were teenagers at the time. Moore, 70, has denied the accusations and said he is the victim of a witch hunt. Gena Richardson told the Washington Post that Moore, then a 30-year-old attorney, had repeatedly asked her for a date in 1977 just before or after she turned 18. Richardson said she finally agreed and went to a movie with Moore, the Post said. In a dark parking lot at a mall in Gadsden, Alabama, Richardson said Moore gave her an unwanted, \\u201cforceful\\u201d kiss that scared her, the Post reported. Another woman, Tina Johnson, told AL.com, an Alabama news site, that Moore groped her while she was in his Alabama law office on legal business in 1991. Johnson, who was 28 at the time, said she visited Moore\\u2019s office with her mother, who had hired Moore in a custody case involving Johnson\\u2019s 12-year-old son. Johnson said Moore grabbed her buttocks as she left. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t pinch it, he grabbed it,\\u201d Johnson told AL.com. Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations from either woman, and Moore\\u2019s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Five other women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct or of dating them when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. National Republican Party leaders have responded with demands that he drop out of the Senate race. The Dec. 12 special election will fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was named U.S. attorney general last spring. Moore on Wednesday denied the allegations of the first five women to step forward. \\u201cWe are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin and motivation,\\u201d he said in a statement. Moore also said he believed a message that one of the accusers, Beverly Young Nelson, said he had written in her high school yearbook had been tampered with. Nelson accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s. Nelson displayed the yearbook message at a news conference in New York, where she made the allegations on Monday. Moore\\u2019s campaign on Wednesday demanded that Nelson turn over the yearbook to a neutral custodian so a handwriting expert could examine it. The Alabama state party\\u2019s leadership met on Wednesday night to discuss their stance and took no action, news media reported.  Republican leaders in Washington have asked Moore to withdraw from the race and said they are exploring write-in options for the election.  U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has spoken to President Donald Trump and others about the situation. Trump appeared at the White House on Wednesday but did not mention Moore. Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot. If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore.  Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. But a new poll on Wednesday, released by the Senate Republicans\\u2019 campaign arm, had Jones surging to a 12-point lead since the allegations surfaced. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump\\u2019s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year\\u2019s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at wiping out the Republicans\\u2019 52-48 Senate majority. Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans are working with news media to discredit him. The Washington Post first disclosed allegations by four women about their relationships with Moore when they were teenagers, ranging in age from 14 to 18. One of the women said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 and Moore was in his 30s.\",\n          \"EU lawmakers propose cuts in aid to Turkey tied to membership bid The European Parliament proposed on Wednesday to reduce EU funds to Turkey that are linked to its stalled bid to join the bloc, a call EU leaders are expected to back given a deteriorating relations with Ankara. Of the 217 million euros set to go to Turkey for reforms, infrastructure and agriculture in 2018, EU lawmakers agreed to cut up to 80 million euros. Of that, 50 million euros should be cut at first, with a further 30-million-euro reduction if Turkey does not improve its human rights record.  Turkey is not respecting freedom of speech, freedom of expression, human rights and is drifting further away from European democratic standards,  said centre-right lawmaker Siegfried Muresan, who led the budget discussions.   We cannot pretend we don t see that,  he told Reuters, emphasizing that the cuts would affect only the money earmarked for political reforms, not for infrastructure and farming. EU leaders must still sign off on the cuts but are expected to do so after an agreement at a summit last week to reduce the so-called pre-accession aid that is meant to help EU candidate countries prepare for membership. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who pressed for action on Turkey during her re-election campaign, described Turkish behavior on human rights as  unacceptable  in Brussels last Thursday. The European Parliament s decision came on the first day of the trial in Istanbul of 11 human rights activists in Turkey, including a German and a Swedish national. At the EU summit, Merkel said that the rule of law in Turkey was  moving in the wrong direction , in a reference to the large-scale purge that President Tayyip Erdogan has carried out following a failed coup attempt in July 2016. While the EU condemned the coup attempt, the scope of Erdogan s response, his detention of U.S. and European citizens including dual nationals, and his jibes at Germany  for what he has called  Nazi-like  behavior have soured EU-Turkey ties. Erdogan says the purges across society are necessary to maintain stability in a NATO country bordering Iraq and Syria. Launched in 2005 after decades of seeking the formal start of an EU membership bid, Ankara s membership negotiations were always sensitive for France and Germany because of Turkey s status as a large, mainly Muslim country. They are not officially frozen, despite calls from Austria to formally scrap Turkey s EU membership program. That is in part because the EU relies on Ankara to take in Syrian refugees in return for billions of euros of aid. But a majority of EU countries, led by Germany and the Netherlands, say it no longer makes sense to fund political reforms in Turkey when formal EU membership talks have not taken place since last year. Aside from money that the EU gives Turkey as part of its  2016 migration deal, Ankara was set to receive 4.4 billion euros from the EU between 2014 and 2020. Some EU governments want that money to go to non-governmental groups in Turkey, not to Ankara.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n

ousted World No 12 Yeo Jia Min\n","Malvika Bansod politely declined the offer of having legendary coach Irwansyah sit for her All England opening match against Singaporean Yeo Jia Min. The Indonesian perfectly understood, as Malvika and her regular coach for the last two years at Thane’s Shrikant Vad Academy, Vignesh Devlekar, had a plan to take down the World No 12.\n","\n","The 23-year-old from Nagpur had lost to Jia Min previously and was coming off a first-round loss from Orleans. But pushing herself beyond limits of exhaustion, with both players utterly knackered by the end, Malvika recorded a stunning 21-13, 10-21, 21-17 victory to advance to the second round. Things were tricky at 11-9 in the decider, but Malvika did well to conserve energy, and mix her usually well-executed high tosses and lifts with attacking openings on cross shots as Jia Min tired out, fading off at the baseline.\n","\n","Vignesh had won five national ranking titles in 2019 in doubles, and played Maldives Open, the only international trip he could afford on his parents’ salaries that year – mother a BMC teacher, and father a clerk in a PSU. “The lockdown ended my playing dreams and I had no funds anyway. But when coaching Malvika, I lean on my weaknesses – I never had a big attack or great physical strength. I was good at finding solutions,” Devlekar says. The long rallies and tall tosses that would strain Jia Min, the coach and athlete had analysed thoroughly.\n","In addition, Malvika dumped low serves in the large Birmingham hall for high serves -again pressuring Jia Min’s neck – and injected pace into her first stroke. The Indian was prepared for the long rallies, but had no intention of defending endlessly. She created openings, pouncing on the short lengths.\n","Malvika has compiled nearly a dozen thick diaries where she jots down details of fitness workouts she observes when at tournaments and national camps. “She must be the only player at this level (World No 28) who designs own fitness. We are desperately looking for an experienced trainer but we don’t have the funds for it yet. So, she plans it herself,” Vignesh notes.\n","Same shots, different paths\n","Malvika, a cerebral player, has spent last few months devising two strokes from the same position, guided by Vad and Vignesh, tweaking angles with wrist work, because a giant smash isn’t suddenly going to materialise. “We work within our limitations, but we are looking to get her stronger if we get a trainer,” he adds.\n","\n","The engineering graduate who had beaten Olympic bronze medallist Gregoria Tunjung at China, has immersed herself even deeper into badminton, and shut out all noise that questions if she has a future when 23 already. “Qualifying for LA Olympics is the plan. We are working towards it,” Vignesh says, adding they hit it off, geeking out on the sport because he was in constant analysing/plotting mode as coach. A BWF Level 1 certified coach, he’s pursuing his MBA alongside, but the natural aptitude for coaching and the bond he struck with Malvika has brought good results.\n","All evenings see her work on fitness by herself. “She’s working hard like crazy. We don’t have funds for beyond the coach. Hopefully if we get results and few Top 10 wins, they will consider funding her,” Vignesh says.\n","\n","\n","'''"],"metadata":{"id":"7RR6CaD52Wh5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742032862342,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinav Saxena","userId":"17349312672039099735"}}},"execution_count":22,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prediction = predict_news_article(sample_news1)\n","print(\"Prediction:\", prediction)"],"metadata":{"id":"RzlPnXaO2ddI","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1742032865069,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":772,"user":{"displayName":"Abhinav Saxena","userId":"17349312672039099735"}},"outputId":"dd2848d9-bb1c-49c1-face-a4bad8048df0"},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Prediction: Real News\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sample_news2 = '''\n","Their untold stories need to be told': Teens capture India's labourers in pictures\n","The elderly woman gazes wistfully into the distance, her hands curled over a basket of tobacco, surrounded by the hundreds of cigarettes she has spent hours rolling by hand.\n","\n","The photograph is one of several snapped by student Rashmitha T in her village in Tamil Nadu, featuring her neighbours who make traditional Indian cigarettes called beedis.\n","\n","\"No-one knows about their work.
